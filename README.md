First of all, thank you for visiting this repository! To be fair, I had no idea this project was going to become what it is today. Complex ideas tend to take a life of their own, and at times when it seems the most chaotic, it usually means that's when the idea is most alive. But when you're in it, working on it, it feels like hitting the ground over and over, expecting something to happen. Luckily, I kept on wacking!

My idea for this was initiated in early 2018, and due to funding drawbacks and time constraints, my ability to create this was hampered by a lot of outside forces. However, those forces allowed me to make the best decision for this project: to open source it.

## So What Is This?

At its core, it's an open source framework for enabling safe, over-the-internet control, of an automated system. As you can tell from the title, I chose to automate a hydroponics machine. If you don't know what that is, it's essentially a robot that grows plants by running water through the plants roots. 

Although I chose this type of device, you can choose literally whatever kind of thing you want to control. HOWEVER! I _highly recommend_ not controlling things that which are safety sensitive, such as parts of a moving vehicle, appliances in a home, security devices, and other devices which can cause serious harm if the possibility they got hacked.

## Introduction

Welcome to the world of open source hydroponics! In recent years, there has been a growing interest in hydroponics - a method of growing plants without soil, using nutrient-rich water as the medium. What makes it even more exciting is that hydroponics has gone open source, which means that the technology and knowledge behind it are now freely accessible to anyone who wants to learn and contribute.

In this article, we will explore why open source hydroponics technology is so important and how it can positively affect your life. From enabling sustainable agriculture to promoting food security, open source hydroponics has the potential to revolutionize the way we grow food and address some of the most pressing challenges we face today.

## Why Open Source Hydroponics Matters

### Sustainability

One of the key reasons why open source hydroponics is important is because it offers a sustainable way to grow food. Traditional agricultural practices often rely on soil, which can be depleted of nutrients, require large amounts of water, and be susceptible to pests and diseases. In contrast, hydroponics allows for precise control over the nutrients, water, and environmental conditions, resulting in higher yields and less waste.

By making hydroponics technology open source, we are democratizing access to sustainable farming methods. Farmers, researchers, and enthusiasts from all around the world can now collaborate, learn from each other, and improve upon existing designs to create more efficient and environmentally friendly hydroponic systems. This fosters innovation and empowers communities to adopt sustainable practices that can help mitigate the impact of climate change on agriculture.

### Food Security

Open source hydroponics also has the potential to enhance food security. With the world's population projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, there will be increasing pressure on food production. Traditional farming methods may struggle to keep up with this demand, especially in regions with limited arable land or unfavorable growing conditions. Hydroponics, on the other hand, can be implemented in a wide range of environments, including urban areas, deserts, and remote locations.

Open source hydroponics allows communities to take control of their food production, reducing their dependence on external food sources and increasing their self-sufficiency. This is particularly relevant in regions where access to fresh, nutritious food is limited, or where natural disasters or other disruptions can disrupt the food supply chain. By sharing knowledge and resources, open source hydroponics can empower communities to produce their own food sustainably, leading to improved food security and resilience.

### Education and Learning

Another important aspect of open source hydroponics is its potential for education and learning. Hydroponics is an interdisciplinary field that combines principles of plant biology, chemistry, physics, and engineering. By making hydroponics technology open source, we are creating opportunities for learning and skill development in these areas.

Open source hydroponics projects often provide documentation, tutorials, and educational resources that can help people of all ages and backgrounds to learn about the science and technology behind hydroponics. This can be particularly beneficial for students, teachers, and researchers who can access the latest knowledge and tools for their studies or experiments. Open source hydroponics also promotes a culture of sharing and collaboration, where people can learn from each other's experiences, experiment with new ideas, and contribute to the collective knowledge of the community.

## How Hydroponics Can Positively Affect Your Life

Now that we have explored the importance of open source hydroponics, let's take a closer look at how hydroponics can positively affect your life:

### Healthier Food Choices

Hydroponically grown produce is known for its high nutritional value and taste. With precise control over nutrient levels and growing conditions, hydroponic plants can thrive and produce healthier, more flavorful fruits and vegetables. This means that you can enjoy a steady supply of fresh, nutrient-rich produce right at your fingertips, regardless of the season or weather conditions. By incorporating hydroponic-grown food into your diet, you can improve your overall health and well-being, and make better choices for you and your family.

### Sustainable Gardening

If you are passionate about gardening or want to grow your own food but lack suitable soil or outdoor space, hydroponics can offer a sustainable solution. Open source hydroponics technology allows you to create your own indoor or outdoor hydroponic garden, using readily available materials and equipment. You can grow a wide variety of plants, from herbs and leafy greens to fruits and flowers, all without the need for soil.

Hydroponics uses less water compared to traditional soil-based gardening, as the water in the system can be recirculated and reused. This can help conserve water, which is especially important in regions where water scarcity is a concern. Additionally, hydroponics eliminates the need for harmful pesticides or herbicides, reducing the environmental impact of your gardening practices. By adopting hydroponics as a sustainable gardening method, you can contribute to a greener, more eco-friendly lifestyle.

### Learning and Innovation

Open source hydroponics also offers a unique opportunity for learning and innovation. By accessing open source hydroponics projects, you can learn about the science, technology, and engineering principles behind hydroponics. You can experiment with different designs, nutrient formulations, and growing techniques, and contribute your own ideas and improvements to the community. This hands-on learning experience can be rewarding and educational, whether you are a student, a hobbyist, or a professional.

Moreover, open source hydroponics fosters innovation by enabling collaborative problem-solving. Communities of hydroponic enthusiasts, farmers, and researchers can come together to tackle challenges such as improving system efficiency, developing new crop varieties, or addressing specific regional needs. By sharing knowledge, expertise, and resources, open source hydroponics can lead to breakthroughs and advancements in the field, benefitting not just the community but also the broader society.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, open source hydroponics technology holds significant importance in promoting sustainability, food security, education, and innovation. It offers a sustainable way to grow food, promotes self-sufficiency and resilience, and provides opportunities for learning, experimentation, and collaboration. By adopting hydroponics and contributing to the open source hydroponics community, you can positively affect your life and make a meaningful impact on the future of agriculture.

So, why wait? Join the open source hydroponics movement today and be a part of the revolutionizing agriculture for a sustainable future!
