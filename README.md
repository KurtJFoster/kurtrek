NOTE: I made this repo public on May 7th, 2023, which by no means is a reason to think everything works just yet! This project is still in the very early stages of development.

First of all, I want to thank you for visiting this repository!

I have a sign in page [[Kurtrek.com/signin](https://kurtrek.com/signin "Heading link")] which allows you to track your project progress. No subscription needed!

## So What Is This?

At its core, it's an open source framework for enabling safe, over-the-internet control, of an automated system. 

Although I chose a hydroponics machine, you can choose literally whatever kind of thing you want to control.

#### A Word of Caution

I _highly recommend_ **not controlling things that which are safety sensitive**, such as parts of a moving vehicle, appliances in a home, security devices, and other devices which can cause serious harm, if in the worst case possibility they got hacked, or if an unsuspecting individual got control of the device and didn't know what they were doing. Please always refer to the licence in this repository.

## Be Forwarned: This Project has a Major Learning Curve

If you want to build exactly what I've outlined for a hydroponic machine, you're in the right place! There's no prerequisites to just copy essentially what I've made, and I hope the documentation is thorough enough.

However, if you want to customize my result to your exact liking, you'll essentially be required to learn the exact same things I had to learn to make this project, if not more unknown items as well.

Either route you take, expect to learn at least something regarding the following technology stacks:

#### Web / App Development

- HTML / JavaScript / CSS
- React.js
- Node.js with Express
- Socket.io
- MySQL
- Passport
- NGINX / Docker / Kubernetes
- DigitalOcean (hosting)

#### Electrical / Mechanical Design

- Arduino / RaspberryPi / Beagleboard
- 3D CAD Modeling
- 2D CAD Drawings
- Programmable Logic Controllers
- Electrical troubleshooting

And that's it. Don't be too overwhelmed if you are! 

The documentation on [Kurtrek.com](https://kurtrek.com/ "Heading link") will allow you to follow along, and i'm here to assist you if you need any help!

## Resources

There are monumental resources at your disposal. From simple how-to's online to horticulture textbooks, if you have a question about anything regarding hydroponics, or perhaps just want to see what's possible, check out these resources below.

### Online Materials

> #### Kyle Gabriel's [Automated Hydroponic System](https://kylegabriel.com/projects/2020/06/automated-hydroponic-system-build.html) spans nearly 27,000 words (equivalent to a 100 page book!) and is a completely free resource.


### Books

> #### A good textbook is [Hydroponic Food Production](https://www.powells.com/book/hydroponic-food-production-9781439878675) by Howard M. Resh. It provides a high level industrial perspective on mass production of hydroponic farms. Introduces the reader into the chemistry behind nutrient dosing, and brings up important aspects of controling problems that might arise during the lifetime of the plant.
