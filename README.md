Greetings fellow code-seeker,

My name is Kurt and I started this project. The webpage "kurtrek.com" is the current home for a fully functional web based application which allows the direct login from any where in the world into the "birds eye" view of the modelOne cultivator. Much in the same way an individual accesses their smart home apps through their smartphone. The modelOne is engineered to automatically grow a variety of plants utilizing hydroponics and is designed to be as energy efficent and reliable for the device footprint. We are still working through some major design decisions (prototypes are still in construction/testing) for modelOne itself and the website. Please stay tuned for updates.

If you have any questions, comments or concerns, please message the owner directly with the following email: fostkurt@gmail.com.

_Thank you._
