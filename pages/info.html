            <h4>What's At Stake</h4>
                <p>"People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction..."</p>
                <p>So how do we solve this reality that the world is heading towards ever higher risk?</p>
                <p>Welcome to the greatest century of innovation. The rate at which technology progesses boggles the mind. Everyday the rate is accelerating, faster and faster. We shoot for the stars (understandably), whilst our people's rate of migration over the next thirty years alone will be more than 200 million people. The America's and European political upheaval movements caused by the Syrian Refugee Crisis is estimated to have caused the mass migration of around 6.8 million people. This estimate by 2050 would be the outcome of not just a dozen Syrian Refugee level events, but over 30 within the next 30 years.</p>
                <p>Events following in parallel with the Syrian Refugee Crisis total at least 24.7 million migrants starting with the Bolivarian Revolution in 2014 to the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine. This coupled with Syria's total means 31.5 million people have migrated from new events since 2011. That gives an average of at least 3 million migrants per year. Although this is about half the rate which was alluded to in the previous estimate, this is already the current rate. As drought and famine increase, authoritarian regimes will rise from this societal degredation. Leading to an ever higher rate of migration.</p>
                <p>Just by looking at this simple fact alone, you must ask yourself; if I had to migrate to a different country/state right now, based on an unforseen calamity, what would I have to leave? When food, supplies, and money go low, what will you do? At some point, it boils down to three things: food, water, and shelter. Without these, we're fracked!</p>
