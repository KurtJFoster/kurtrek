            <p>Decentralising technology to live with society and nature, off-grid, with a small physical and carbon footprint.</p>
            <p>In order to achieve this, we will provide free and open source wiring diagrams, mechanical assembly diagrams, bill of materials, and instructions on assembly. All parts shall be at reasonable costs, and designs shall be reliable and repairable to the furthest extent possible.</p>

        <article>
            <h1>Join Us In This Fight To Preserve The Planet</h1>
            <p>We understand that time is a commodity, so we'll get right down to it:</p>
            <p><i><a href="https://kurtrek.com" style="text-decoration: none; color: #616161;">Kurtrek.com</a></i> is the home for accessing personally controlled off-grid technologies.</p>
            <p>The reason for this is because off-grid technology merits a strength, it does nothing but add to a trully decentralized economy.</p>

            <h1>So What's The Solution?</h1>
            <p>It's a hard pill to swallow. So here it is... In terms of living within the bounds of what the planet requires, and to live comfortablly while also feeling like it's the 21st century, the solution is:</p>
            <p><i>Society needs to gravitate toward living in a "Cybertruck style" tiny home, towable, transportable, and capable of producing and managing it's own fresh water, food, electricity, hygiene for occupents, and to have everything be reliable, repairable by onboard occupents, and safe for at least an onboard family or group of at least five adult people.</i></p>
            <p>From an engineering perspective, this is an utterly insane ask. It's like trying to land on Mars, profitably.</p>

            <p>"Off-grid", "decentralization", these are the terms of a nerdy, self-proficent folk who want to live in the middle of nowhere, right? Well these are the claims of a society that has always known centralized systems, interdependant on eachother. We have the technology today, for implementing self proficent systems to allow anyone to live practically anywhere in the world, and yet still feel incredibly connected to the rest of society.</p>
            <p>So why isn't this idea more mainstream? The answer is simple, we have old systems that still exist because corporations stand to benefit from keeping the system in place. It's akin to the disruption that Tesla caused on the automotive and energy industries. Building out technology to improve self-reliance is a movement that creates a lot of powerful enemies. Tesla I believe, is not the example, but rather the exception to this rule.</p>
            <p>Even with this in mind, companies like Tesla and others will come and go, ultimately building products that are designed to be limited in access to just a subset of the wealthiest of humanity. So what about the rest of us? How do we have access to off-grid technologies without paying a premium? That's where we come in. We're open source, fully transparent, and fully commited to creating a self-reliant society. We don't require funding or investment, that's not why we're here. We're here to grow the cause of off-grid technologies. To be accessable to as many people as possible.</p>

            <h1>This May Be The Biggest Problem We Have Ever Faced (besides the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_crisis" style="text-decoration: none; color: #666666; ">climate crisis</a>)</h1>

            <p>We're asking for none other than the complete overhaul of how we live.</p>

            <h1>The Big Picture When Regarding The Risks Ahead</h1>
            <p>There's no doubt when technology advances, so do the capabilities of it being used against the common good. The good part is that’s the extent of the problem, and there is a near equal counter attack to preventing damage, as it can have enormous impacts, not just economically. The aim of this website is to aid in that aspect at the individual level. To provide a well rounded approach toward fighting a multitude of dangers that are headed our way. Unfortunately, people can still suffer no matter the protections, it's just the way the world is. However, wouldn't we all agree that maximizing the probability of survival is what's most important?</p>

            <h1>Speciality Utilization For The Tiny House</h1>

            <p>Item by item, the dangers regarding our safety could stretch over an entire book. It’s in this hope that we’ve layed out an important summary of the risks. In button form, the risks we believe are as follows:</p>

            <div class="grid-container">
                <div class="item1">Food</div>
                <div class="item2">Water</div>
                <div class="item3">Habitat</div>
                <div class="item4">Hygiene</div>
                <div class="item5">Energy</div>
                <div class="item6">Sewage</div>
                <div class="item7">7</div>
                <div class="item8">8</div>
                <div class="item9">9</div>
                <div class="item10">10</div>
            </div>

            <p>Now that we’ve laid out what it is we aim to do, here is what it would look like in context. Now please bear with us, as this solution is <i>faaaaar</i> from the best solution. Sometimes, it’s impossible to get to the best, especially when we’re actually just one person. Make no mistake, that feeling that it’s far from the best will feel more true the longer time progresses. With this anxiety in mind, we liken our mission to that of designing a well built and oiled machine like the ones built during World War II. but we feel some technologies than outlast innovation</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>So how do we solve this reality that the world is heading towards ever higher risk of collapse?</p>
            <p>Welcome to the greatest century of innovation. The rate at which technology progresses boggles the mind. Everyday the rate is accelerating, faster and faster. We shoot for the stars (understandably), whilst our people's rate of migration over the next thirty years alone will be more than 200 million people. The America's and European political upheaval movements caused by the Syrian Refugee Crisis is estimated to have caused the mass migration of around 6.8 million people. This estimate by 2050 would be the outcome of not just a dozen Syrian Refugee level events, but over 30 within the next 30 years.</p>
            <p>Events following in parallel with the Syrian Refugee Crisis total at least 24.7 million migrants starting with the Bolivarian Revolution in 2014 to the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine. This coupled with Syria's total means 31.5 million people have migrated from new events since 2011. That gives an average of at least 3 million migrants per year <i>from regime aggression alone</i>. Although this is about half the rate which was alluded to in the previous estimate, this is already the <b>current</b> rate. As drought and famine increase, authoritarian regimes will rise from this societal degradation. Leading to an ever higher rate of migration.</p>
            <p>Just by looking at this simple fact alone, you must ask yourself; if I had to migrate to a different country/state right now, based on an unforeseen calamity, what would I have to leave? When food, supplies, and money go low, what will you do? At some point, it boils down to three things: food, water, and shelter. Without these, we're fracked!</p>
            <h4>The Cultivator</h4>
            <p>That's where the cultivator comes in. By allowing the production of food in a small, energy efficient space, food security starts to become a solvable issue.</p>
            <p>Now what does a cultivator do? I thought they were those weird shovel things that plowed the ground and were pulled by oxen.</p>
