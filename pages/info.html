            <p>Decentralising technology for living with society and nature, off-grid with a small footprint.</p>
            <p>In order to achieve this, we will provide free and open source wiring diagrams, mechanical assembly diagrams, bill of materials, and instructions on assembly. All parts shall be at reasonable costs, and designs shall be reliable and repairable to the furthest extent possible.</p>

        <article>
            <h1>What is this?</h1>
            <p>We're glad you asked, because we were confused at first too.</p>
            <p>kurtrek.com is the placeholder for an open source system for anyone, anywhere, </p>

            <h1>The Big Picture When Regarding The Risks Ahead</h1>
            <p>There's no doubt when technology advances, so do the capabilities of it being used against the common good. The good part is that’s the extent of the problem, and there is a near equal counter attack to preventing damage, as it can have enormous impacts, not just economically. The aim of this website is to aid in that aspect at the individual level. To provide a well rounded approach toward fighting a multitude of dangers that are headed our way. Unfortunately, people can still suffer no matter the protections, it's just the way the world is. However, wouldn't we all agree that maximizing the probability of survival is what's most important?</p>

            <h1>Speciality Utilization For The Tiny House</h1>

            <p>Item by item, the dangers regarding our safety could stretch over an entire book. It’s in this hope that we’ve layed out an important summary of the risks. In button form, the risks we believe are as follows:</p>

            <div class="grid-container">
                <div class="item1">Food</div>
                <div class="item2">Water</div>
                <div class="item3">Habitat</div>
                <div class="item4">Hygiene</div>
                <div class="item5">Energy</div>
                <div class="item6">Sewage</div>
                <div class="item7">7</div>
                <div class="item8">8</div>
                <div class="item9">9</div>
                <div class="item10">10</div>
            </div>

            <p>Now that we’ve laid out what it is we aim to do, here is what it would look like in context. Now please bear with us, as this solution is <i>faaaaar</i> from the best solution. Sometimes, it’s impossible to get to the best, especially when we’re actually just one person. Make no mistake, that feeling that it’s far from the best will feel more true the longer time progresses. With this anxiety in mind, we liken our mission to that of designing a well built and oiled machine like the ones built during World War II. but we feel some technologies than outlast innovation</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>So how do we solve this reality that the world is heading towards ever higher risk of collapse?</p>
            <p>Welcome to the greatest century of innovation. The rate at which technology progresses boggles the mind. Everyday the rate is accelerating, faster and faster. We shoot for the stars (understandably), whilst our people's rate of migration over the next thirty years alone will be more than 200 million people. The America's and European political upheaval movements caused by the Syrian Refugee Crisis is estimated to have caused the mass migration of around 6.8 million people. This estimate by 2050 would be the outcome of not just a dozen Syrian Refugee level events, but over 30 within the next 30 years.</p>
            <p>Events following in parallel with the Syrian Refugee Crisis total at least 24.7 million migrants starting with the Bolivarian Revolution in 2014 to the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine. This coupled with Syria's total means 31.5 million people have migrated from new events since 2011. That gives an average of at least 3 million migrants per year <i>from regime aggression alone</i>. Although this is about half the rate which was alluded to in the previous estimate, this is already the <b>current</b> rate. As drought and famine increase, authoritarian regimes will rise from this societal degradation. Leading to an ever higher rate of migration.</p>
            <p>Just by looking at this simple fact alone, you must ask yourself; if I had to migrate to a different country/state right now, based on an unforeseen calamity, what would I have to leave? When food, supplies, and money go low, what will you do? At some point, it boils down to three things: food, water, and shelter. Without these, we're fracked!</p>
            <h4>The Cultivator</h4>
            <p>That's where the cultivator comes in. By allowing the production of food in a small, energy efficient space, food security starts to become a solvable issue.</p>
            <p>Now what does a cultivator do? I thought they were those weird shovel things that plowed the ground and were pulled by oxen.</p>
